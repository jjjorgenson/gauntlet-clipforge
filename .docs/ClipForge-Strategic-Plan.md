# ClipForge Strategic Planning Document
## Desktop Video Editor - Production Success Plan

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Philosophy:** MVP as Checkpoint, Not Throwaway

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a strategic approach to building ClipForge where the MVP checkpoint (Tuesday 10:59 PM) establishes production-quality foundations that evolve into the final submission (Wednesday 10:59 PM), rather than being discarded code.

**Key Principle:** Every line of code written for MVP should be production-grade and extensible.

---

## 1. Architecture Foundation (Checkpoint-to-Production Strategy)

### 1.1 Framework Decision Matrix

**Critical First Decision:** Electron vs Tauri

| Consideration | Electron | Tauri | Recommendation |
|--------------|----------|-------|----------------|
| **Setup Speed** | ⭐⭐⭐ Fast (hours) | ⭐⭐ Moderate (day) | Electron for tight timeline |
| **FFmpeg Integration** | ⭐⭐⭐ Mature libs | ⭐⭐ Requires Rust | Electron easier |
| **Performance** | ⭐⭐ Good | ⭐⭐⭐ Excellent | Tauri better long-term |
| **Binary Size** | ~200MB | ~10MB | Tauri wins |
| **Web APIs** | ⭐⭐⭐ Full access | ⭐⭐⭐ Full access | Tie |
| **Learning Curve** | ⭐⭐⭐ JS/TS only | ⭐⭐ JS + Rust | Electron simpler |

**Strategic Recommendation:** **Electron** for this timeline, BUT structure code to be framework-agnostic.

### 1.2 Production-Grade Architecture Pattern

Use **Clean Architecture** from the start:

```
src/
├── main/                    # Electron main process
│   ├── ipc/                 # IPC handlers (abstraction layer)
│   ├── services/            # Core services
│   │   ├── MediaService.ts       # File I/O, FFmpeg control
│   │   ├── RecordingService.ts   # Screen/webcam capture
│   │   └── ExportService.ts      # Video rendering
│   └── main.ts
│
├── renderer/                # Frontend (framework-agnostic as possible)
│   ├── core/                # Business logic (NO UI dependencies)
│   │   ├── domain/          # Core entities
│   │   │   ├── Clip.ts      # Timeline clip model
│   │   │   ├── Track.ts     # Timeline track model
│   │   │   └── Project.ts   # Project state
│   │   └── usecases/        # Application logic
│   │       ├── ImportClip.ts
│   │       ├── TrimClip.ts
│   │       └── ExportVideo.ts
│   │
│   ├── ui/                  # UI components (can be swapped)
│   │   ├── components/      # Reusable UI
│   │   ├── timeline/        # Timeline-specific UI
│   │   └── preview/         # Video preview UI
│   │
│   └── adapters/            # External integrations
│       ├── FFmpegAdapter.ts
│       └── IPCAdapter.ts
│
└── shared/                  # Shared types/utils
    ├── types.ts
    └── constants.ts
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Core logic (domain + usecases) can survive a framework migration
- UI layer can be replaced without touching business logic
- Services are testable in isolation
- MVP → Final is evolution, not rewrite

---

## 2. Technology Stack (Production-Ready Choices)

### 2.1 Core Stack

**Desktop Framework:**
- **Primary:** Electron 28+ with TypeScript
- **Packaging:** electron-builder (production builds from day 1)

**Frontend:**
- **Framework:** React 18 + TypeScript (fastest dev time)
- **UI Library:** Tailwind CSS (rapid styling)
- **State:** Zustand (simple, performant)
- **Timeline:** Custom Canvas + React (full control)

**Media Processing:**
- **Library:** fluent-ffmpeg + @ffmpeg.wasm (fallback)
- **Rationale:** fluent-ffmpeg for production exports, wasm for quick previews

**Video Playback:**
- **Player:** HTML5 `<video>` element (native, fast)
- **Enhancement:** video.js for advanced controls (add post-MVP if needed)

### 2.2 Critical Dependencies (Install These First)

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "electron": "^28.0.0",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "zustand": "^4.4.0",
    "fluent-ffmpeg": "^2.1.2",
    "uuid": "^9.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/react": "^18.2.0",
    "@types/node": "^20.0.0",
    "typescript": "^5.2.0",
    "electron-builder": "^24.0.0",
    "vite": "^5.0.0",
    "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^4.0.0"
  }
}
```

### 2.3 FFmpeg Strategy

**Critical Setup Steps:**
1. Include FFmpeg binary in app package
2. Set correct PATH in Electron main process
3. Validate FFmpeg availability on startup
4. Graceful fallback if missing

```typescript
// services/MediaService.ts
import ffmpeg from 'fluent-ffmpeg';
import path from 'path';
import { app } from 'electron';

export class MediaService {
  private ffmpegPath: string;
  
  constructor() {
    // Production: bundle FFmpeg with app
    const isDev = !app.isPackaged;
    this.ffmpegPath = isDev
      ? 'ffmpeg' // Assumes system FFmpeg in dev
      : path.join(process.resourcesPath, 'bin', 'ffmpeg');
    
    ffmpeg.setFfmpegPath(this.ffmpegPath);
  }
  
  async validateFFmpeg(): Promise<boolean> {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      ffmpeg.getAvailableFormats((err) => {
        resolve(!err);
      });
    });
  }
}
```

## 3. MVP Checkpoint Strategy (Tuesday 10:59 PM)

### 3.1 MVP Feature Scope (Prioritized)

**Must-Have (6-8 hours each):**
1. ✅ **App Shell** (2 hours)
   - Electron app launches
   - Main window with basic layout
   - IPC communication working
   - electron-builder config for native build

2. ✅ **Video Import** (3 hours)
   - Drag & drop MP4/MOV files
   - File picker dialog
   - Store file path + metadata
   - Display filename in media library

3. ✅ **Simple Timeline** (4 hours)
   - Canvas-based timeline (zoomable x-axis)
   - Display single clip as rectangle
   - Playhead indicator
   - Click to place clip

4. ✅ **Video Preview** (3 hours)
   - HTML5 video element
   - Load video from file path
   - Play/pause controls
   - Sync playhead with timeline

5. ✅ **Basic Trim** (4 hours)
   - Set in/out points on clip
   - Update preview to respect trim
   - Visual trim handles on timeline

6. ✅ **Export MP4** (4 hours)
   - Use fluent-ffmpeg to trim video
   - Simple export dialog (filename + location)
   - Progress indicator
   - Success notification

7. ✅ **Native Build** (2 hours)
   - electron-builder configuration
   - Build .dmg (Mac) or .exe (Windows)
   - Test packaged app launches

**Total MVP Effort:** ~22 hours (feasible in 1.5 days with focus)

### 3.2 MVP Quality Gates

Before submitting MVP, verify:
- [ ] App launches without errors
- [ ] Can import at least 3 different video files
- [ ] Timeline displays clips correctly
- [ ] Preview plays imported video
- [ ] Trim changes are visible in preview
- [ ] Export produces valid MP4 file
- [ ] Native app works on clean machine (no dev deps)

### 3.3 Code Quality Standards (Even in MVP)

**Non-Negotiable:**
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- No `any` types (use `unknown` if needed)
- Error boundaries in React
- Try-catch around all FFmpeg operations
- User-facing error messages (not console.error)

**Nice-to-Have:**
- ESLint + Prettier configured
- Basic unit tests for core logic
- JSDoc comments on complex functions

---

## 4. MVP → Final Evolution Path (Wednesday)

### 4.1 Post-MVP Feature Additions (Priority Order)

**Phase 1: Recording (4-6 hours)**
- Screen recording via desktopCapturer
- Webcam recording via getUserMedia
- Audio capture from microphone
- Save recordings directly to timeline

**Phase 2: Advanced Timeline (3-4 hours)**
- Multiple clips on timeline
- Clip rearrangement (drag to reorder)
- Split clip at playhead
- Delete clips
- Undo/redo stack

**Phase 3: Multi-Track (2-3 hours)**
- Two tracks: main + overlay
- Picture-in-picture support
- Track visibility toggle

**Phase 4: Polish (2-3 hours)**
- Transitions between clips (fade in/out)
- Basic audio controls (volume, mute)
- Export presets (720p, 1080p, 4K)
- Loading states and progress bars

**Phase 5: UI/UX (2-3 hours)**
- Keyboard shortcuts (space = play/pause, delete = remove clip)
- Tooltips and help text
- Responsive layout
- Dark mode toggle

### 4.2 Extensibility Points (Build These into MVP)

**Plugin Architecture for Future:**
```typescript
// core/domain/Effect.ts
export interface Effect {
  id: string;
  type: 'filter' | 'transition' | 'text' | 'audio';
  apply: (input: string, output: string) => Promise<void>;
}

// This interface exists in MVP, but no effects are implemented yet
// Final submission adds: FadeEffect, BlurEffect, TextOverlayEffect
```

**Settings System:**
```typescript
// Store user preferences from day 1
export interface AppSettings {
  theme: 'dark' | 'light';
  defaultExportQuality: '720p' | '1080p' | '4K';
  autoSaveInterval: number; // minutes
  ffmpegPath?: string; // allow custom FFmpeg
}
```

**Project Persistence:**
```typescript
// MVP: Save project to JSON
// Final: Add project history, autosave, recovery
export interface ProjectFile {
  version: string;
  timeline: {
    clips: Clip[];
    tracks: Track[];
  };
  settings: AppSettings;
  metadata: {
    created: Date;
    modified: Date;
  };
}
```

## 5. Risk Mitigation & Contingencies

### 5.1 High-Risk Areas

**Risk 1: FFmpeg Not Working**
- **Impact:** Cannot export videos (MVP failure)
- **Mitigation:** 
  - Test FFmpeg integration in first 4 hours
  - Have @ffmpeg.wasm as backup (slower but works)
  - Prebuilt FFmpeg binaries for Mac/Windows/Linux

**Risk 2: Timeline Performance Issues**
- **Impact:** Laggy UI, poor UX
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use Canvas instead of DOM (faster)
  - Implement virtual scrolling
  - Debounce zoom/scroll events
  - Profile early, optimize as needed

**Risk 3: Video Playback Sync Issues**
- **Impact:** Playhead doesn't match video time
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use `video.currentTime` as source of truth
  - Implement requestAnimationFrame loop for playhead
  - Add offset calibration if needed

**Risk 4: Build/Packaging Fails**
- **Impact:** Cannot submit native app
- **Mitigation:**
  - Test electron-builder in first 6 hours
  - Have two machines available (primary + backup)
  - Cloud build via CI as last resort

**Risk 5: Scope Creep**
- **Impact:** Run out of time, incomplete submission
- **Mitigation:**
  - Stick to priority matrix (P0 → P1 → P2)
  - Set 2-hour time boxes per feature
  - If stuck >30 min, pivot or ask for help

### 5.2 Fallback Plans

**If Timeline Slips:**
- Reduce Final submission scope to: MVP + Recording + Basic Timeline Editing
- Skip: Multi-track, transitions, advanced effects

**If FFmpeg is Too Hard:**
- Use @ffmpeg.wasm for everything (accept slower exports)
- Limit export resolution to 720p

**If Electron is Too Slow:**
- Pivot to Tauri (only if you have Rust experience)
- More likely: optimize Electron (disable hardware acceleration if needed)

---

## 6. Development Workflow (Optimized for Speed)

### 6.1 Time Allocation (48 hours total)

**Day 1 (Monday, Oct 27) - 12 hours**
- 0-2h: Setup (Electron + React + TypeScript boilerplate)
- 2-4h: FFmpeg integration + validation
- 4-7h: Video import + media library UI
- 7-10h: Timeline canvas implementation
- 10-12h: Basic video preview player

**Day 2 (Tuesday, Oct 28) - 16 hours**
- 0-3h: Timeline clip interaction (add, select, move)
- 3-6h: Trim functionality (handles + preview sync)
- 6-9h: Export pipeline (FFmpeg trim + save)
- 9-11h: Native build + testing
- 11-14h: Bug fixes + MVP polish
- 14-16h: Buffer time (catch up or start Final features)
- **10:59 PM: MVP SUBMISSION ✅**

**Day 3 (Wednesday, Oct 29) - 16 hours**
- 0-4h: Screen recording implementation
- 4-7h: Webcam recording + simultaneous capture
- 7-10h: Advanced timeline (multi-clip, split, delete)
- 10-12h: Multi-track + PiP
- 12-14h: UI polish + keyboard shortcuts
- 14-15h: Final build + testing
- 15-16h: Documentation + demo video
- **10:59 PM: FINAL SUBMISSION ✅**

### 6.2 Productivity Techniques

**Pomodoro Sprints:**
- 50 min focused work
- 10 min break (walk, stretch, water)
- Every 4 sprints: 30 min break (meal, nap, reset)

**Progress Tracking:**
```markdown
# Tuesday 6:00 PM - Checkpoint
- [x] App launches ✅
- [x] Video import working ✅
- [x] Timeline rendering ✅
- [x] Preview player ✅
- [ ] Trim functionality (in progress - 60% done)
- [ ] Export pipeline (not started - PRIORITY)
- [ ] Native build (not started - PRIORITY)

## Next 4 hours:
1. Finish trim (1h)
2. Export pipeline (2h)
3. Native build (1h)
```

**Decision Speed:**
- Stuck >15 min? Google/ChatGPT/Claude
- Stuck >30 min? Simplify or pivot
- No perfection allowed until Final submission day

## 12. Final Thoughts

### 12.1 Mindset for Success

**Embrace "Good Enough":**
- Perfect is the enemy of done
- Ship working features over beautiful code
- Polish comes after functionality

**Stay Focused:**
- Resist feature creep
- Prioritize ruthlessly
- Time-box everything

**Learn in Public:**
- Document challenges you solve
- Share progress (builds accountability)
- Ask for help when stuck

### 12.2 Post-Project Reflection

After submission, capture:
- What went well?
- What would you do differently?
- What was hardest technically?
- What surprised you?
- Would you use Electron again?

This project is a proving ground for rapid prototyping, production-quality architecture, and shipping under pressure. The MVP→Final approach mirrors real product development: build a foundation you're proud of, then iterate quickly.

**You've got this. Ship fast, ship smart, ship proud.**
