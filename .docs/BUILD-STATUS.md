# ClipForge Build Status

## ✅ Build Successfully Completed

Date: October 28, 2025  
Build Type: Windows Unpacked Application  
Version: 1.0.0  

### What Works

1. **Unpacked Application** ✅
   - Location: `release/win-unpacked/ClipForge.exe`
   - Size: ~210 MB (executable)
   - FFmpeg binaries successfully bundled
   - Application tested and functional

2. **FFmpeg Bundling** ✅
   - Path: `release/win-unpacked/resources/resources/bin/`
   - `ffmpeg.exe`: 194 MB
   - `ffprobe.exe`: 194 MB
   - Verified working in production mode

3. **Core Features** ✅
   - Video import with duration parsing
   - Thumbnail generation
   - Timeline editing
   - Video preview with custom `media://` protocol
   - Trim functionality
   - Export with FFmpeg

### Known Issues

1. **NSIS Installer Build Fails**
   - **Error**: `Cannot create symbolic link : A required privilege is not held by the client.`
   - **Cause**: Windows Developer Mode not enabled OR elevated permissions required
   - **Impact**: Cannot create `.exe` installer (only unpacked app works)
   - **Workaround**: Distribute the `win-unpacked` folder as a ZIP

2. **Code Signing**
   - No code signing certificate available
   - `forceCodeSigning: false` set in config
   - Users will see "Unknown Publisher" warning

### Distribution Options

#### Option 1: Portable App (Current)
Distribute `release/win-unpacked/` as a ZIP file:

```bash
# Create distributable
cd release
Compress-Archive -Path win-unpacked -DestinationPath ClipForge-v1.0.0-Portable.zip
```

**Pros:**
- No installation required
- Works immediately
- No admin rights needed
- FFmpeg already bundled

**Cons:**
- Larger download (~400 MB)
- No Start Menu integration
- No file associations

#### Option 2: Fix Installer (Future)

**Requirements:**
1. Enable Windows Developer Mode:
   - Settings → Update & Security → For developers → Developer Mode
2. OR run PowerShell as Administrator

**Steps:**
```powershell
# Run as Administrator
cd C:\Users\fyres\Gauntlet\clipforge
npm run electron:build
```

This will create:
- `ClipForge Setup 1.0.0.exe` (~300 MB NSIS installer)

### File Structure (Unpacked)

```
release/win-unpacked/
├── ClipForge.exe                    (210 MB)
├── resources/
│   ├── app.asar                     (app code)

│           └── README.md
├── locales/

```

### Production Path Resolution

The `FFmpegManager` correctly resolves paths in production:

```typescript
// Development:
__dirname/../../../../resources/bin/ffmpeg.exe

// Production:
process.resourcesPath/resources/bin/ffmpeg.exe
→ C:\Users\[USER]\...\ClipForge\resources\resources\bin\ffmpeg.exe
```

### Testing Checklist

- [x] App launches
- [x] FFmpeg binaries detected
- [x] Import video works
- [x] Thumbnails generate
- [x] Video preview plays
- [x] Timeline operations work
- [x] Trim dialog functional
- [x] Export creates video file
- [ ] NSIS installer (blocked by symlink error)

### Next Steps

**For Developer:**
1. Test portable app distribution (ZIP the `win-unpacked` folder)
2. Consider enabling Developer Mode to build installer
3. Obtain code signing certificate for production releases

**For Users:**
1. Download `ClipForge-v1.0.0-Portable.zip`
2. Extract to desired location
3. Run `ClipForge.exe`
4. FFmpeg is already included - no additional setup needed

### Build Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run electron:dev

# Build unpacked app
npm run electron:build

# The unpacked app is usable even if installer build fails
```

### Conclusion

**The build is successful and functional!** 

The unpacked application in `release/win-unpacked/` is fully working with FFmpeg properly bundled. The installer build failure is a Windows permission issue, not a critical problem. The app can be distributed as a portable application by ZIPping the `win-unpacked` folder.

## Build Artifacts

Generated files:
- ✅ `release/win-unpacked/` - Full working application
- ✅ `release/builder-effective-config.yaml` - Build configuration used
- ❌ `release/ClipForge Setup 1.0.0.exe` - Not created (symlink error)

**Recommendation:** Ship the unpacked app as v1.0.0 and address installer in v1.1.0 after enabling Developer Mode or acquiring proper build environment.
