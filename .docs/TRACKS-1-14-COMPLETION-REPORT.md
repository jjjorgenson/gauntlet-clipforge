## 🔧 UX Enhancements Summary

### Issue: Broken Drag-Drop from Media Library to Timeline

**Problem Identified:**
- MediaItem was setting `text/plain` data only
- Timeline drop handler expected `application/clipforge-clip` JSON
- Data mismatch caused silent failures
- Clips would not appear on timeline when dropped

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Updated `MediaItem.tsx` to set comprehensive clip data in correct format
2. Enhanced Timeline drop handler to properly parse and validate data
3. Added collision detection to prevent clip overlap
4. Implemented snap-to-clip for precise positioning
5. Added visual feedback during drag operation

**Result:**
✅ Drag-drop from media library to timeline now works flawlessly
✅ Clips appear at exact drop position
✅ Collision avoidance prevents overlap
✅ Snap functionality aids precise placement

---

### Issue: Incorrect Aspect Ratios

**Problem Identified:**
- MediaItem thumbnails used `object-cover` CSS
- This cropped videos to fit 16:9 container
- Vertical videos (9:16) and 4:3 content were distorted
- Timeline clips had no aspect ratio indication

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Changed MediaItem thumbnail CSS to `object-contain`
2. Improved drag preview with aspect-fit calculation
3. Added aspect ratio badge to Timeline clips
4. Displays common ratios (16:9, 4:3, 21:9, 9:16, 1:1)
5. Shows resolution for non-standard ratios

**Result:**
✅ Thumbnails preserve original aspect ratio
✅ Letterboxing applied for non-16:9 content
✅ Drag preview accurately represents video dimensions
✅ Timeline clips show aspect ratio information
✅ Better visual understanding of video properties

---

### Issue: Poor Visual Feedback During Drag

**Problem Identified:**
- No indication where clip would be dropped
- Track target was unclear
- No visual confirmation of drag state
- Users had to guess drop position

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Added drop zone state tracking
2. Created visual drop zone indicator with:
   - Track highlight with dashed blue border (rgba(64, 150, 255, 0.6))
   - Vertical drop line at exact position (rgba(64, 150, 255, 0.9))
   - Arrow indicator at top of line
   - Real-time position updates
3. Clean animation and proper z-indexing
4. Automatic cleanup on drag leave/drop

**Result:**
✅ Clear visual indication of drop target track
✅ Precise drop position shown with vertical line
✅ Professional drag-and-drop UX
✅ Reduced user errors and improved confidence
